# Measurement and Stations Activity - SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask

## Overview

Today's work focused on creating a robust Flask web application that interfaces with an SQLite database to perform various operations related to meteorological measurements and weather stations. The application leverages the power of SQLAlchemy to perform object-relational mapping (ORM) for easier database management and manipulation.

## Objectives

- Set up SQLite database with tables for `Measurement` and `Station`.
- Use SQLAlchemy to create a session and perform queries on the database.
- Create a Flask web application that offers multiple endpoints to retrieve data.

## Database Schema

The database contains two tables:

1. `Measurement` - Contains meteorological data like temperature (`tobs`), precipitation (`prcp`), and the date of the measurement (`date`).
2. `Station` - Contains information about weather stations, including their name, latitude, longitude, and elevation.

## SQLAlchemy Setup

We used SQLAlchemy to interact with our SQLite database. The main operations were:

- Creating models for `Measurement` and `Station`.
- Setting up a session to execute SQL queries programmatically.

## Flask Routes

The Flask application features several endpoints for querying the database. Here are some key routes:

### General Routes
- `@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])` - Welcome route.
  
### Measurement-related Routes
- `@app.route('/stations', methods=['GET'])` - Retrieves all station names.
- `@app.route('/measurement_stations', methods=['GET'])` - Retrieves unique station IDs from `Measurement`.
- `@app.route('/dates', methods=['GET'])` - Retrieves the most recent date and a date one year ago.
- `@app.route('/temperature_stats', methods=['GET'])` - Retrieves temperature statistics (min, max, avg) for each station.

### Station-related Routes
- `@app.route('/stations', methods=['GET'])` - Retrieves all station information, including geolocation details.

### Temperature-related Routes
- `@app.route('/tobs', methods=['GET'])` - Retrieves temperature observations (TOBS) for the most active station for the last year.

### Precipitation-related Routes
- `@app.route('/precipitation', methods=['GET'])` - Retrieves all date and precipitation values.
- `@app.route('/precipitation_last_year', methods=['GET'])` - Retrieves date and precipitation values for the last year.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- SQLite
- SQLAlchemy

## Summary

Today's work was instrumental in integrating SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to build a comprehensive web application capable of performing various meteorological data operations. This application will serve as a solid foundation for future enhancements, including more advanced querying options and a front-end user interface.


## Difficulties encountered when using Flask

1. **Data Querying Complexities**: One major challenge encountered was forming the correct SQLAlchemy queries to pull the necessary data from the SQLite database. Missteps in querying resulted in errors or incorrect data being returned, affecting the API's responses.

2. **Route Conflicts**: Another issue faced was conflicting routes. Multiple endpoints served similar but different data, making it difficult to debug and ensure proper routing. The Flask error logs did not provide enough context to easily identify the cause of the conflicts, further complicating the matter.

3. **JSON Serialization**: The third challenge involved serializing the SQLAlchemy query results into a JSON format that could be returned by Flask. Although `jsonify` and other methods were used, handling nested or complex objects posed a challenge, complicating the data output process.

These difficulties represented some of the key challenges faced during the exercise. As a result, another python file app1.py was created to serve as a test for codes. 
Central graders may use that to check the codes used.
